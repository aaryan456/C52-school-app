    <h1>My Experiences in DAV Public School</h1>    
    <h3> I have been studying in DAV Public School since Lower Kinder garden (LKG)  (Now in class 9). </p>
    <h3>DAV Public School has excelent Teachers, Extra-curricular such as Sports-Day, Singing-Competition, Science-Exhibition</p>
    <h3>The teachers are very kind and polite here they always help the students if they have any doubt or problems</h3>
    <h3>They also tell us that dont keep working for sucess work for progress and sucess will automitically reach to you</h3>
    <h3>these days locked in the home, taking online classes I never felt that I was out of school or anything different from my school's environment.x </h3>
